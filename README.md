# SubSavers


- With the rise of digital services, users often sign up for multiple platforms but forget to cancel them when they’re no longer needed, resulting in significant wasted spendings. In fact, studies show that the average person loses nearly $400 each year on subscriptions they don’t actively use.

- To tackle this problem, we've built "SubSavers" - An AI-powered financial assistant that helps users save money by tracking subscriptions, analyzing usage, and enabling one-click cancellations. It identifies underused services, sends reminders before free trials convert to paid plans, and simplifies subscription management—all in one place.
